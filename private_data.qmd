The depth and breadth of information can often dictate the boundary between success and failure for founders and their startups. Private data sources are a particular advantage to entrepreneurs who have access to them.  These data sources offer detailed, proprietary insights that are not readily available through public data. They resources encompass a wide array of databases and platforms, each catering to different facets of __market research__, __competitive analysis__, and __consumer behavior__.

## Why Private Data Matters 

Private data sources provide:

- __Detailed Market Insights__: Access to granular data about market trends, industry benchmarks, and consumer preferences.
- __Competitive Edge__: Information from these sources can give businesses a competitive advantage by providing insights that are not accessible to everyone.
- __Risk Mitigation__: Helps in forecasting and mitigating risks by providing detailed historical data and predictive insights.

Entrepreneurs who have access to these sources, and understand how to effectively leverage them, can make informed decisions, anticipate market movements, and tailor their strategies to meet precise market demands.

## Ethics of Using and Sharing Private Data

### Privacy and Data Governance
As powerful as private data sources are, they come with significant ethical responsibilities, particularly concerning privacy, data governance, and compliance with legal standards.

__Privacy and Confidentiality__: When dealing with private data, it is crucial to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of the information are maintained. Entrepreneurs must be vigilant about:

- __Data Protection Laws__: Complying with local and international data protection laws, such as GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California, which dictate how data should be handled and protected.
- __Consent and Transparency__: Ensuring that data is collected and used transparently, with the consent of all parties involved, particularly when dealing with sensitive information.

::: {.callout-tip title="Use of BYU Library Databases"}

In general, the private databases in the Harold B. Lee Library is freely permitted for use in classroom work.  They generally exclude using the databases for commercial purposes including internships, consulting, and employment in non-BYU companies.  Fortunately for entrepreneurial management majors at BYU, our use is for educational purposes.  There are individual documents in these databases that would sell for thousands of dollars to enterprise customers but are free to you for educational use. While it is possible to abuse your access to these proprietary databases, you should not. 
:::

__Responsible Use of Data__: Ethical use of private data also means using it responsibly:

- __Bias and Fairness__: Being aware of and mitigating any biases in the data that could lead to skewed conclusions or unfair business practices.
- __Accuracy and Integrity__: Maintaining the accuracy and integrity of data by using reputable sources and verifying the information before application.

__Sharing and Distribution__: The sharing and distribution of data must be handled with care to avoid misuse:

- __Confidential Agreements__: Using nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) where necessary to protect sensitive information.
- __Controlled Access__: Limiting data access to only those who need it for legitimate business purposes, thus minimizing the risk of data breaches or leaks.

__Ethical Considerations in Entrepreneurship__: Ultimately, ethical considerations in using private data sources should guide how entrepreneurs collect, analyze, and apply data to ensure that their practices contribute positively to their business without compromising ethical standards.

Understanding and adhering to ethical guidelines when using private data sources is not just about compliance; it's about building trust with customers, partners, and the public. Entrepreneurs who prioritize ethical data practices are better positioned to build sustainable and respected businesses.

Learn more [here](https://www.mergentkbr.com/).
:::

#### Features and Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Financial Data**: Offers exhaustive data on industry-specific financial ratios, essential for assessing operational success and financial health.
- **Ease of Use**: The platform is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible even to those new to financial analysis.

##### Industry Reports

Mergent Key Business Ratios' Industry Reports provide comprehensive financial metrics including detailed ratios, variances, and norms across hundreds of industries. These reports are designed to give students a granular look at industry standards and performance metrics.

- **Visualization Tools**: In addition to tables, users can visualize data through charts that display ratios and norms, making it easier to interpret complex financial data.

While the Industry Reports provide detailed data, they do not offer guidance on interpreting these metrics within broader business or economic contexts. This presents an educational opportunity:

##### Company Reports

Mergent Key Business Ratios' Company Reports provide targeted financial data and ratios for a broad spectrum of companies, offering specific insights into both public and private companies. These reports are designed to enable detailed financial analysis by allowing users to search for companies by various criteria.

- **Targeted Financial Data**: Access detailed financials and ratios for a wide range of companies. Users can perform searches that are not limited to pre-populated lists, allowing for the exploration of less common or smaller entities.
- **Customizable Searches**: Search functionality includes filters such as location, company type, and DUNS Number, making it easier to find specific companies.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: For public companies, the platform provides comprehensive views of the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and financial ratios, complete with charts for better visualization.


Users can access extensive financial details for public companies, which include visual representations of financial statements and ratios.

The availability of data for private companies can be limited, with reports often noting "No data available for the selected criteria." This limitation requires users to be mindful of the scope of their research, particularly when dealing with private entities.

##### Industry Ratios

Mergent Key Business Ratios offers a robust analysis of industry-specific financial ratios, providing valuable insights into the solvency, efficiency, and profitability across various industries. This data is crucial for understanding the financial health and trends within specific sectors.

By examining the change in financial ratios over time, you can identify trends that may indicate improving or deteriorating industry health. The quartile data provides a benchmark for comparing a company's performance against industry averages, helping to pinpoint areas of strength or weakness.

While the data is extensive within a given industry, it does not facilitate comparisons across different industries, which could be useful for broader market analysis. It also does not include explanations for why ratios may vary over the years nor does it suggest how companies might improve their financial metrics. You need to interpret the raw data independently or supplement it with other sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
